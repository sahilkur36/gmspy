``gmspy`` is a python package for dealing with ``ground motions time-histories`` induced by earthquakes, including various ``intensity measures (IMs)``, ``elastic response spectra``, ``constant ductility response spectra``, ``pre-processing``, etc.

To use, install `gmspy` from [gmspy-PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/gmspy/):

```python
pip install --upgrade gmspy
```
